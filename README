Finds peaks in peak simple files generated from a chromatograph (N20 and CH4)

Note: Negative mV values are ignored by peak finder

peak_main.rb: A ruby program that accepts two command line arguments; <peak simple filename> <Pos.tolerance size> 

(default tolerance is 110 mV) 2nd argument is optional

If the file is valid it uses the peak_finder gem to find the peaks, and extract the start/end times and the volt measures

that are used by the peak_integration gem to find the area of the peaks discovered. 

The main class then outputs a comma seperated text file with the Start, End, and Area in a file named millivolt.txt

This program can process Peak Simple files with or without timestamps included as columns.
